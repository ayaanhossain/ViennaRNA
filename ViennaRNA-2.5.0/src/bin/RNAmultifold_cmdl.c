These properties are either computed for\na particular arrangement (concatenation) of sequences, for the full ensemble of\nthe complex of input RNAs, or all complexes formed by the input sequences up to\na specified number of interacting sequences.\nOutput consists of a PostScript \"dot plot\" file containing the pair\nprobabilities, see the RNAfold man page for details.\nThe program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting of the\nsingle character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.\n\n";

 * Scan elements of ARGV for option characters given in OPTSTRING.

 * then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
 * (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
 * is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
 * from each of the option elements.
 *
 * If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
 * updating `custom_optind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
 * resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.
 *
 * If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns -1.
 * Then `custom_optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
 * that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
 * so that those that are not options now come last.)
 *
 * OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
 * If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
 * return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `custom_opterr' to
 * zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.
 *
 * If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
 * so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
 * ARGV-element, is returned in `custom_optarg'.  Two colons mean an option that
 * wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
 * it is returned in `custom_optarg', otherwise `custom_optarg' is set to zero.
 *
 * If OPTSTRING starts with `-' or `+', it requests different methods of
 * handling the non-option ARGV-elements.
 * See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.
 *
 * Long-named options begin with `--' instead of `-'.
 * Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique
 * or is an exact match for some defined option.  If they have an
 * argument, it follows the option name in the same ARGV-element, separated
 * from the option name by a `=', or else the in next ARGV-element.
 * When `getopt' finds a long-named option, it returns 0 if that option's
 * `flag' field is nonzero, the value of the option's `val' field
 * if the `flag' field is zero.
 *
 * The elements of ARGV aren't really const, because we permute them.
 * But we pretend they're const in the prototype to be compatible
 * with other systems.
 *
 * LONGOPTS is a vector of `struct option' terminated by an
 * element containing a name which is zero.
 *
 * LONGIND returns the index in LONGOPT of the long-named option found.
 * It is only valid when a long-named option has been found by the most
 * recent call.
 *
 * Return the option character from OPTS just read.  Return -1 when there are
 * no more options.  For unrecognized options, or options missing arguments,
 * `custom_optopt' is set to the option letter, and '?' is returned.
 *
 * The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option letters,
 * optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter takes an
 * argument, to be placed in `custom_optarg'.
 *
 * If a letter in OPTS is followed by two colons, its argument is optional.
 * This behavior is specific to the GNU `getopt'.
 *
 * The argument `--' causes premature termination of argument scanning,
 * explicitly telling `getopt' that there are no more options.  If OPTS begins
 * with `--', then non-option arguments are treated as arguments to the option
 * '\0'.  This behavior is specific to the GNU `getopt'.
